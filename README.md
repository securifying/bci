# Keyword Research for BCI Pune

# 3 finalised keywords are:
# 1) “english class”
# 2) “ielts exam”
# 3) “french class”


----------
# Information on how the keywords were chosen:


## A few terminologies associated with the document are:

Keyword Research: An essential step in SEO and advertising that helps you understand what people are searching for and which search terms (keywords) to advertise for. 
Trend Analysis: An aspect of keyword research that involves analysing search trends.
CPC: Cost Per Click, the amount you have to pay to the advertisement platform (Google) whenever the Ad is clicked.
Competition: If two entities both give money to advertise the same keywords, then an automated *bidding* is done, and the amount of clicks you get (your reach) is proportional to your budget, this is called as competition.
CTR: Click Through Rate, measures the number of *clicks* ******advertisers receive on their ads per number of impressions.


## The basics: 

You have a product “abc” and a website with more info on that product, say, “www.abc.com”
A person looking for your product “abc” would search for “abc near me” for example.
You have a competitor say, “xyz” who also has a product “abcd” which is similar to your product “abc”
In order to gain an edge over “xyz”, you will allocate some budget and choose keywords to advertise, example:
Budget: ₹100 / day
Keywords: “abc”, “abc near me”, etc..

Since “abc” is a fairly popular search term on Google, your CPC will be higher, but so will your reach.

If “xyz” decides to advertise his product “abcd” and allocates ₹200 / day, there will be an automated bidding for placement of ads. Obviously with double your budget, he will have almost proportionally double your reach.

So, if 120 people search for “abc” or “abcd”, 80 will be shown xyz’s advertisement, whereas, 40 will be shown your advertisement.

## Understanding what all BCI offers:

Spoken English / IELTS, Foreign Languages, Personality Development, Computer Courses, Programming Languages, Corporate Training.


In order to get a fair idea of the keywords, I first ran some online tools that would take any given website and find the keywords on that website.

To start off with the keyword research, I went to the one place where it all started, Google itself. They (Google Ads) offer us a free [keyword planner tool](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_in/home/tools/keyword-planner/).
You give it any website and it gives you the most popular keywords about that website.

Here’s a list of all the relevant keywords from the BCI [website](http://www.britishcoachinginstitute.com/), in descending order of their search popularity, given to us by Google’s Keyword planner tool.

Next, I began looking for other ways to identify keywords. 
That took me to the [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=IN) page. 

Google Trends shows you real *graphs* of how popular a search term is, in which area, and it even allows you to compare up to 5!

Now the question is, which 3 search keywords would you choose, if you had to advertise only 3 out of the 7 courses that BCI offers?
The answer to that question is two fold:

1. For which course is faculty already available?
2. Which course have people in Pune searched for the most?

Let us answer the 2nd question.

Assuming all but the computer courses are available, we have 5:
Spoken English, IELTS, Foreign Languages, Personality Development and Corporate Training.

Putting the 5 courses into Google Trends (For past two years) as:
“spoken english class”, “ielts class”, “foreign language class”, “personality development class”, “corporate training”
We see this:

It is immediately clear that the most sought after, is “Spoken English”, followed by “Corporate Training” in Pune.


----------
# Foreign Language

We notice here that “foreign language class” is at the bottom, because nobody really would search that way, the probable keyword is “german class” or “french class” and so on.. 

So we compare all the foreign languages to gauge which would make the most sense to advertise:

![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8F14C615B86F1EB04FE18996AC2288B0899ECC33534905CC5D7D28E5BB9464DB_1534165849645_image.png)


We see here that the rankings are as follows: French, German and Japanese.

Now the question one must ask here is, do all people search for “<foreign language> class” or do some people search for “learn <foreign language>”


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8F14C615B86F1EB04FE18996AC2288B0899ECC33534905CC5D7D28E5BB9464DB_1534166115956_image.png)


The overall trend has remained the same, people are most interested in French, German and then Japanese. 
But the key thing to realise here is, it is better to advertise for “learn german” than for “german class” and for “french class” than for “learn french”

**Conclusion:** If you have to advertise for a foreign language, go for the keywords:
“learn german” or “french class”, based on availability of teachers and the language examination dates.

We shall leave aside the foreign language courses for now and come back to them a little later..

Moving on to the other courses, we have: 

Spoken English, IELTS, Personality Development and Corporate Training.

# Spoken English

 

![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8F14C615B86F1EB04FE18996AC2288B0899ECC33534905CC5D7D28E5BB9464DB_1534167981577_image.png)


**Conclusion:** As is clearly visible, advertising for the keyword “english class” is far better as compared to anything else, or go for “spoken english” if the rate or competition for “english class” is very high.


----------
# IELTS


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8F14C615B86F1EB04FE18996AC2288B0899ECC33534905CC5D7D28E5BB9464DB_1534168565987_image.png)


It is clear that there is little to no interest for “ielts class”, so it does not make sense to add that to the list, but what about just “ielts”?


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8F14C615B86F1EB04FE18996AC2288B0899ECC33534905CC5D7D28E5BB9464DB_1534168974413_image.png)


It has a much higher popularity than “ielts exam”

**Conclusion:** Go for “ielts” but if cost per click is high, then go for “ielts exam” since it is more specific and cheaper.


----------
# Personality Development


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8F14C615B86F1EB04FE18996AC2288B0899ECC33534905CC5D7D28E5BB9464DB_1534169696346_image.png)


**Conclusion:** There is little to no interest for “personality development class” searches in Pune.
It is not a good decision to allocate any budget for it. If needed, “soft skills” is a better keyword.


----------
# Corporate Training


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_8F14C615B86F1EB04FE18996AC2288B0899ECC33534905CC5D7D28E5BB9464DB_1534170257595_image.png)


**Conclusion:** “Corporate training” is a good keyword to advertise, but a less specific but more popular keyword could be “career development”

Now that we have our chosen keywords for each of the offered courses, let us put them all in and see what we get..

# Final verdict: 

It is expected that we will see a good click-through rate for “english class” and “ielts” but the number of clicks on the other keywords might not be as good..

**Suggestion:** Quora answers to questions like “Which is the best spoken english class in Pune?” should be added with BCI’s name in the answer.
